    <h1>How Dawkins got pwned (part 4)</h1><time>Thursday, October 18, 2007 at 5:20 AM</time>

  <article>
    <p>(See <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/09/how-dawkins-got-pwned-part-1.html">part 1</a>, <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/10/how-dawkins-got-pwned-part-2.html">part 2,</a> and <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/10/how-dawkins-got-pwned-part-3.html">part 3</a>.)</p>

    <p>To review, I&rsquo;ve argued that Professor Dawkins is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pwn">pwned</a> because he&rsquo;s chosen quite unthinkingly to lend his literary talents to a received tradition I call <em>Universalism</em>, which is a nontheistic Christian sect. Some other current labels for this same tradition, more or less synonymous, are <em>progressivism</em>, <em>multiculturalism</em>, <em>liberalism</em>, <em>humanism, leftism, political correctness</em>, and the like. My only excuse for minting my own term is that these other labels, since they are in common use, imply various associations which may confuse the reader.</p>

    <p>In my humble but convinced opinion, Universalism is far more important, far more dangerous, and far more antirational than its theistic Christian competitors, which Professor Dawkins attacks with such fury. He thinks he&rsquo;s a Galileo, Vavilov or Darwin. But if my perspective is accurate, Professor Dawkins is more a Caccini, Lysenko or Wilberforce. He is pwned in every sense of the word, and history will treat him in its usual harsh manner. A few librarians may remember him as a curiosity of the era.</p>

    <p>Of course, I am just a humble blogger and I have no control at all over history. Sometimes I write out my screeds in tiny, cramped longhand, and staple them to telephone poles. You, dear reader, should treat them as if you found them that way. After all, anyone can start a blog.</p>

    <p>In my opinion, however, Universalism is the dominant modern branch of Christianity on the Calvinist line, evolving from the English Dissenter or Puritan tradition through the Unitarian, Transcendentalist, and Progressive movements. Its ancestral briar patch also includes a few sideways sprigs that are important enough to name but whose Christian ancestry is slightly better concealed, such as Rousseauvian laicism, Benthamite utilitarianism, Reformed Judaism, Comtean positivism, German Idealism, Marxist scientific socialism, Sartrean existentialism, Heideggerian postmodernism, etc, etc, etc. All but the first can be traced back to the first, and Rousseau himself was a Genevan and acknowledged his political debt to Calvin&rsquo;s republic. So Universalism traces almost all of its memetic DNA to this hateful little phony, this pissant, heretic-roasting tyrant on the lake, Jehan Cauvin &mdash; so well-sketched by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/right-heresy-Castellio-against-Calvin/dp/B0006EUMJE">Stefan Zweig</a>.</p>

    <p>Which is no reason to automatically condemn it. After all, Scarlett Johansson traces all of her actual DNA to chimps. Evolution can change anything. Universalism as we know it today, a la <a href="http://www3.iath.virginia.edu/sixties/HTML_docs/Resources/Primary/Manifestos/SDS_Port_Huron.html">Port Huron Statement</a>, would be quite unrecognizable to any of its 16th-century or 17th-century ancestors. It would shock the living daylights out of most of its 18th-century or 19th-century ones. It is what it is. It is not something else.</p>

    <p>Most of my previous discussions of Universalism have been devoted simply to the task of demonstrating that the label is apt, that the tradition is real, and that its pedigree is accurate. I don&rsquo;t regard this as audacious at all, since most religions and other traditions in history have been named by their enemies. Labels such as <em>Unitarian</em>, <em>Methodist</em>, <em>Whig</em>, <em>Tory</em>, and many others originated as hostile slurs and were subsequently accepted as accurate.</p>

    <p>But again, the thing can only be judged as itself. I&rsquo;ve described a few ways in which I think Universalism should be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Considered_harmful">considered harmful</a> &mdash; for example, in <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/10/how-dawkins-got-pwned-part-3.html">part 3</a>. But I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve really presented a high-level overview of the thing as it is today, abjuring any and all snide references to the Jukes and Kallikaks in its stud book.</p>

    <p>Universalism, in my opinion, is best described as a <em>mystery cult of power</em>.</p>

    <p>It&rsquo;s a <em>cult of power</em> because one critical stage in its replicative lifecycle is a little critter called the <em>State</em>. When we look at the big U&rsquo;s surface proteins, we notice that most of them can be explained by its need to capture, retain, and maintain the State, and direct its powers toward the creation of conditions that favor the continued replication of Universalism. It&rsquo;s as hard to imagine Universalism without the State as malaria without the mosquito.</p>

    <p>It&rsquo;s a <em>mystery cult</em> because it displaces theistic traditions by replacing metaphysical superstitions with philosophical <em>mysteries</em>, such as <em>humanity</em>, <em>progress</em>, <em>equality</em>, <em>democracy</em>, <em>justice</em>, <em>environment</em>, <em>community</em>, <em>peace</em>, etc.</p>

    <p>None of these concepts, as defined in orthodox Universalist doctrine, is even slightly coherent. All can absorb arbitrary mental energy without producing any rational thought. In this they are best compared to Plotinian, Talmudic, or Scholastic <a href="http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/%7Ejim/wrongthoughts.html">nonsense</a>. (I link to this David Stove piece often, and I encourage anyone who hasn&rsquo;t read it to do so. No, this does not constitute an endorsement of everything that Professor Stove ever wrote.)</p>

    <p>The Universalist mysteries are best regarded as <em>mechanisms</em>. When we apply our neohominid intuitions to a successful adaptive system such as Universalism, we should think of its goal as replicative success. Of course, a tradition is not a person, just as a meme is not a gene, and it no more has goals than a meme has Mendelian inheritance. It&rsquo;s especially important not to confuse the personal goals of Universalists with the adaptive goals of Universalism. But with these caveats, we can use this analogy to deploy our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neurons">mirror neurons</a> in our own defense.</p>

    <p>For Universalism as for any other tradition, the adaptive purpose of a mystery is to <em>confuse</em> its host. Lacking a clear perception of reality, the infected host behaves in ways that an uninfected host would not. We can call this confusion <em>camouflage</em>.</p>

    <p>As compared to the behavior of the uninfected, sometimes these actions are beneficial to the host, or to a group which includes the host, but their actual effect is contrary to the host&rsquo;s ethical standards. We can call this <em>positive camouflage</em>. Sometimes these actions are harmful to the host or a group which includes the host. We can call this <em>negative camouflage</em>.</p>

    <p>If we can deploy the e-word, positive camouflage contributes to evil by convincing those who do evil that they are actually doing good. For example, if we believe Himmler&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posen_speech">Posen speech</a>, those who perpetrated the Holocaust believed that they were carrying out a difficult but necessary duty. Negative camouflage contributes to evil by preventing its victims from resisting it. While we&rsquo;re on Nazis, the great example is the <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E7D9143BF934A1575BC0A96F958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print">Oxford Union peace resolution</a>.</p>

    <p>Of course, if we are to deploy the e-word, we have to tackle the thorny problem of defining good and evil. We have two approaches to this.</p>

    <p>One, we can define our moral axis with respect to Universalism itself. For example, if we apply this test to Nazism, we see that Nazism was evil even with respect to itself. Nazi ethics defined good as the power and prosperity of the <em>Deutsche Volk</em> and its guide Adolf Hitler. The result of Nazi policies was the physical destruction of Germany, the conversion of the German people to Universalism, the total suppression of <em>Volkisch</em> thought, and the death of Adolf Hitler &mdash; not exactly as advertised. This approach gives us <em>reflexive evil</em> or <em>reflexive good</em>.</p>

    <p>Two, we can define our moral axis with respect to the personal or reproductive interests of you yourself, dear reader. If this criterion makes sense only with respect to a group, we can speak of the group of UR readers &mdash; which includes me, because I sometimes do try to slog through my own long posts. If Universalism harms or advances your or our personal interests, we say it exhibits <em>Misesian evil or good</em>. If it harms or advances your or our reproductive interests, it exhibits <em>Darwinian evil or good</em>.</p>

    <p>Darwinian morality is an especially good reality check, because the neohominid brain is of course designed to advance its own Darwinian interests. Any tradition that can persuade it to do otherwise has to be some pretty heavy crack. As we&rsquo;ll see, Universalism more than fits the bill. However, to generate a really strong moral conclusion, we&rsquo;d like to see agreement among all three criteria: reflexive, Misesian and Darwinian.</p>

    <p>One easy way to do this is to examine some scenarios in which Universalism could lead to either the <em>extinction of the neohominid species</em>, or the <em>destruction of Western civilization</em>. Clearly, any such result represents the triumph of reflexive, Misesian and Darwinian evil. And if such results are plausible, worrying about anything smaller is a waste of time.</p>

    <p>Let&rsquo;s unravel this problem by starting with the Universalist mystery of <em>progress</em>, which Professor Dawkins calls the <em>Zeitgeist</em> or <em>Spirit of Time</em>.</p>

    <p>First, it&rsquo;s worth noting that chapter 7 of <em>The God Delusion</em>, in which Professor Dawkins introduces this concept, opens with a quote by one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_O%27Casey">Sean O&rsquo;Casey</a>:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><em>Politics has slain its thousands, but religion<br />
      has slain its tens of thousands</em>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>La Wik describes O&rsquo;Casey as a &ldquo;nationalist and socialist.&rdquo; Frankly, he sounds like an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0330.html">evil little fucker</a>. The evil little fucker was born in 1880, and presumably he uttered his little ort of shite at some point before nationalist, socialist politics &mdash; not to mention National Socialism proper &mdash; managed to slay its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide"><em>tens of millions</em></a>. The fact that Professor Dawkins could, in 2007, quote this Stalinist flack and his fatuous, thoroughly-obsolete line &mdash; and his legion of acolytes swallow it without a hiccup &mdash; may be a sufficient demonstration of Universalist pwnage.</p>

    <p>But if it&rsquo;s worth continuing, it&rsquo;s worth repeating Professor Dawkins&rsquo; definition of the <em>Zeitgeist</em>: <em>a mysterious consensus, which changes over the decades</em>. For some reason, these changes over the decades almost always favor Universalism itself. This is of course <em>progress</em>, and our <em>Spirit of Time</em> bears a suspicious resemblance to the MO of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_providence">Divine Providence</a>, minus of course the Divine bit.</p>

    <p>Since Professor Dawkins does not have Providence to lean on, he is forced to find a rational explanation for this historical curiosity. His struggles are wonderful reading:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Where, then, have these concerted and steady changes in social consciousness come from? The onus is not on me to answer. For my purposes it is sufficient that they certainly have not come from religion.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a href="http://www.econlib.org/LIBRARY/Columns/LevyPeartdismal.html">Exeter Hall</a> would beg to differ. So would <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ward_Beecher">Henry Ward Beecher</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Rauschenbusch">Walter Rauschenbusch</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Sloane_Coffin">William Sloane Coffin</a>, etc, etc.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>We need to explain why the changing moral Zeitgeist is so widely synchronized across large numbers of people and we need to explain its relatively consistent direction.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Indeed.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>First, how is it synchronized across so many people? It spreads itself from mind to mind through conversations in bars and at dinner parties, through books and book reviews, through newspapers and broadcasting, and nowadays through the Internet.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Not to mention the State and its entire educational system, from kindergarten to grad school. Obviously this is less important than &ldquo;bars and dinner parties.&rdquo; But I&rsquo;m just saying.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Changes in the moral climate are signalled in editorials, on radio talk shows, in political speeches, in the pattern of stand-up comedians and the scripts of soap operas, in the votes of parliaments making laws and the decisions of judges interpreting them.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>That&rsquo;s an interesting word &mdash; &ldquo;signalled.&rdquo;</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>One way to put it would be in terms of changing meme frequencies in the meme pool, but I shall not pursue that.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Fortunately, Professor Dawkins, you don&rsquo;t have to.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>What impels it in its consistent direction? We mustn&rsquo;t neglect the driving role of individual leaders who, ahead of their time, stand up and persuade the rest of us to move on with them.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Curiously enough, leaders come in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_jong_il">all</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco">kinds</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollfuss">of</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idi_amin">flavors</a>. We mustn&rsquo;t neglect the fascinating question of why the Universalist ones always win, and the others always lose. Oh, wait, we must neglect it. Obviously these aren&rsquo;t the droids we&rsquo;re looking for.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>In America, the ideals of racial equality were fostered by political leaders of the calibre of Martin Luther King,</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>I know it&rsquo;s cheap, but I simply can&rsquo;t resist the temptation to attach a little innuendo to the word &ldquo;calibre.&rdquo; As Dr. King himself <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/3043/">put it</a>, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a Negro tonight!&rdquo;</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>and entertainers, sportsmen and other public figures such as Paul Robeson, Sidney Poitier, Jesse Owens and Jackie Robinson.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Isn&rsquo;t it interesting how the <em>Zeitgeist</em> seems to correlate with dermal pigmentation?</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The emancipations of slaves and of women owed much to charismatic leaders. Some of these leaders were religious; some were not. Some who were religious did their good deeds because of they were religious. In other cases their religion was incidental.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Presumably if Professor Dawkins discovered a fossil which looked a little like a chimpanzee and a little like a neohominid, he might regard it as an indication of a link between the two. Sadly, in the memetic department, this lobe of his brain seems to be in the off position.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Although Martin Luther King was a Christian, he derived his philosophy of non-violent civil disobedience directly from Gandhi, who was not.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The number of historical solecisms in this sentence is astounding. The modern idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disobedience">civil disobedience</a> &mdash; that is, breaking the actual legal law, in favor of some mysterious higher law, an obvious case of positive camouflage &mdash; dates to neither King nor Gandhi, but to Thoreau and the Transcendentalists, who were of course direct ancestors of Universalism.</p>

    <p>As for Gandhi, this <a href="http://history.eserver.org/ghandi-nobody-knows.txt">Richard Grenier essay</a> is simply essential. But what it fails to point out is that Gandhi&rsquo;s weird communist pseudo-Hinduism was a invention, a sort of Ossianism or Kwanzaa, an Indian equivalent of the phony Gaelic revival associated with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenian">Fenian</a> movement. Like Nehru, Gandhi was a British lawyer with brown skin. Their movement &mdash; like its Irish counterpart &mdash; succeeded entirely through its alliance with British political forces, and in specific the Nonconformist and proto-Universalist Labour Party. For example, in Paul Scott&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jewel_in_the_Crown_%28novel%29">Jewel in the Crown</a>, one character is a Nonconformist missionary nun, and it&rsquo;s taken for granted that she has a picture of Gandhi on her wall and despises the Raj.</p>

    <p>Anyway, to finish with this sport:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>It is beyond my amateur psychology and sociology to go any further in explaining why the moral <em>Zeitgeist</em> moves in its broadly concerted way.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Professor Dawkins, if you were to go any less further, you&rsquo;d need a rear-view mirror.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>For my purposes it is enough that, as a matter of observed fact, it <em>does</em> move, and it is not driven by religion &mdash; and certainly not by scripture.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Which obviously makes it a product of pure reason.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>It is probably not a single force like gravity, but a complex interplay of disparate forces like the one that propels Moore&rsquo;s Law, describing the exponential increase in computer power.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Boys and girls, can you say &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicycle">epicycle</a>?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The epicycle in Professor Dawkins&rsquo; theory of history is needed to explain why, when we look at history, good always prevails over evil. Or almost always:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Even when he was railing against Christianity, Hitler never ceased using the language of Providence: a mysterious agency which, he believed, had singled him out for a divine mission to lead Germany.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This second &ldquo;mysterious agency&rdquo; appears just six pages from Professor Dawkins&rsquo; own <em>Zeitgeist</em>. One really wonders whether this man has read his own book.</p>

    <p>Of course, a theism-independent perspective of memetic evolution eliminates our need for the epicycle. What Professor Dawkins is observing is simply the selective success of Universalism. Universalism succeeded, by definition, because it was better-adapted than its competitors. Since Professor Dawkins is a Universalist, of course he views this as the triumph of good over evil. But his <em>Zeitgeist</em> is no more than the well-known fallacy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias">survivor bias</a>. And Hitler&rsquo;s Providence, which doubtless made itself scarce around 1942, is exactly the same animal.</p>

    <p>So the question remains: why does good so consistently triumph over evil?</p>

    <p>If we exclude supernatural forces which cause the good side to win elections, battles and wars, we are left with no explanation at all of this strange phenomenon, so reminiscent of Tom Stoppard&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosencrantz_&amp;_Guildenstern_Are_Dead">Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern</a>. &ldquo;Heads. Heads. Heads. Heads. Heads...&rdquo;</p>

    <p>It&rsquo;s true that people want to be good. Perhaps we should expect them to flock to the good side, outnumbering the evil. On the other hand, when we remember the phenomenon of positive camouflage, and see that most who do evil think of themselves as doing good, it&rsquo;s hard to take this seriously. And moreover, actual good has to be actually good, whereas evil by definition is capable of anything. If the military advantage is anywhere, it would seem to lie with the latter.</p>

    <p>Essentially, what we&rsquo;ve found behind this particular Universalist mystery is the assertion that Universalism has triumphed because Universalism is good and good triumphs. Good triumphs because Universalism is successful and Universalism is good. Spot the unsubstantiated assertion!</p>

    <p>Just as we have <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/sci_tech/article3067222.ece">no reason at all</a> to assume that neohominid populations are geographically uniform, we have no reason at all to assume that Universalism is good &mdash; in either the reflexive, Darwinian, or Misesian sense. Of course we learned in school that Universalism is good, in at least the first and third senses. But who did we learn this from? Universalist teachers. Again, all we know is that Universalism is successful. And we can say the same of Universalism&rsquo;s ancestors. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whig_history">The winners write history</a>. If Nazism had won its war, citizens of the Nazi 2007 would see history as an inevitable progress toward the National Socialist present.</p>

    <p>Thus, Universalist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicism">historicism</a> is effective camouflage both negative and positive. The circular reasoning behind the mystery of <em>progress</em>, <em>Zeitgeist</em> or <em>Providence</em> dissuades those who might be harmed by Universalism from considering the possibility that Universalism is not, in fact, good, and needs to be fought against. And it persuades those whose interests Universalism advances that they are serving good, not evil.</p>

    <p>We are now in a position to strip off this camouflage and have a look at what&rsquo;s behind it.</p>

    <p>If <em>progress</em> is simply the victory of Universalism, and Universalism need not be entirely good, we need to construct an interpretation of history which recognizes both <em>progress</em> and <em>decay</em>. Where Universalism is good, its victory is by definition <em>progress</em>. Where Universalism is bad, its victory must be <em>decay</em>. Without mysterious or supernatural pro-good forces, we would expect to see some mix of the former and the latter.</p>

    <p>Let&rsquo;s cap this exercise at about 250 years, ie, at 1757. Some Universalist distortions may go back farther, but they dwindle rapidly. Before this period it is usually hard, when reading a typical Universalist history, to tell which side is supposed to be righteous and which wrongtious. Once we get to the American and French Revolutions, we are left in no doubt.</p>

    <p>It is very difficult for a modern American to construct the history of the last 250 years as a history of decay. Decay is especially concealed by the obvious history of technical and scientific progress. While this has no reason at all to correlate with political or cultural progress, the two are certainly not hard to confuse.</p>

    <p>However, one way to look at the question is to look at the traditional opposite of the word <em>progressive</em>: that is, <em>reactionary</em>.</p>

    <p>Howard Zinn, for example, has given us an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_People%27s_History_of_the_United_States">progressive interpretation of history</a>. What is a comparable reactionary narrative? Professor Zinn, of course, would like us to believe that any narrative less progressive than his is reactionary. But perhaps it is only reactionary compared to Professor Zinn.</p>

    <p>What we really need is an interpretation of history so reactionary that it contains no Universalism or proto-Universalism at all. Instead, it should start with the mainstream perspective of 1757, and interpret all evidence of impending Universalism as the story of decline, disaster and decay.</p>

    <p>Then, we can compare the progressive and reactionary narratives on a level playing field, evaluating the relative credibility of both, and decide on what points to accept which &mdash; thus allocating Universalist history, and implicitly Universalism itself, between progress and decay.</p>

    <p>For this we need our pure reactionary theory of history. Needless to say, this is a very specialized product. It is not sold in any stores. It is not even found in a single volume. Nonetheless, the Internet is of great assistance in assembling the product.</p>

    <p>If I had to pick ten books from which to construct a reactionary theory of modern history, I would pick &mdash; in order of composition, which makes a good reading order:</p>

    <ul>

    <p>(A question for readers: can anyone recommend a good reactionary history of the American Revolution? Or should I say, Rebellion? For some reason, I haven&rsquo;t bumped into any Tory treatments which live up to the above standard.)</p>

    <p>Let me also mention <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Fitzjames_Stephen">James Stephen</a>&rsquo;s <a href="http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=572&amp;chapter=39274&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27">Liberty, Equality, Fraternity</a>, a wonderful book which is a little too close to the Maine to make this list, and also suffers from the disability that I have not yet read all of it. However, just to show that there is nothing new under the sun, here is how Stephen&rsquo;s classic opens:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The object of this work is to examine the doctrines which are rather hinted at than expressed by the phrase &lsquo;Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.&rsquo; This phrase has been the motto of more than one Republic. It is indeed something more than a motto. It is the creed of a religion, less definite than any one of the forms of Christianity, which are in part its rivals, in part its antagonists, and in part its associates, but not on that account the less powerful. It is, on the contrary, one of the most penetrating influences of the day. It shows itself now and then in definite forms, of which Positivism is the one best known to our generation, but its special manifestations give no adequate measure of its depth or width. It penetrates other creeds. It has often transformed Christianity into a system of optimism, which has in some cases retained and in others rejected Christian phraseology. It deeply influences politics and legislation. It has its solemn festivals, its sober adherents, its enthusiasts, its Anabaptists and Antinomians. The Religion of Humanity is perhaps as good a name as could be found for it, if the expression is used in a wider sense than the narrow and technical one associated with it by Comte. It is one of the commonest beliefs of the day that the human race collectively has before it splendid destinies of various kinds, and that the road to them is to be found in the removal of all restraints on human conduct, in the recognition of a substantial equality between all human creatures, and in fraternity or general love. These doctrines are in very many cases held as a religious faith. They are regarded not merely as truths, but as truths for which those who believe in them are ready to do battle, and for the establishment of which they are prepared to sacrifice all merely personal ends.</p>

      <p>Such, stated of course in the most general terms, is the religion of which I take &lsquo;Liberty, Equality, Fraternity&rsquo; to be the creed. I do not believe it.</p>

      <p>I am not the advocate of Slavery, Caste, and Hatred, nor do I deny that a sense may be given to the words, Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, in which they may be regarded as good. I wish to assert with respect to them two propositions.</p>

      <p>First, that in the present day even those who use those words most rationally &mdash; that is to say, as the names of elements of social life which, like others, have their advantages and disadvantages according to time, place, and circumstance &mdash; have a great disposition to exaggerate their advantages and to deny the existence, or at any rate to underrate the importance, of their disadvantages.</p>

      <p>Next, that whatever signification be attached to them, these words are ill-adapted to be the creed of a religion, that the things which they denote are not ends in themselves, and that when used collectively the words do not typify, however vaguely, any state of society which a reasonable man ought to regard with enthusiasm or self-devotion.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Compare to Maine&rsquo;s brilliant reactionary blast:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>It has always been my desire and hope to apply the Historical Method to the political institutions of men. But, here again, the inquiry into the history of these institutions, and the attempt to estimate their true value by the results of such an inquiry, are seriously embarrassed by a mass of ideas and beliefs which have grown up in our day on the subject of one particular form of government, that extreme form of popular government which is called Democracy. A portion of the notions which prevail in Europe concerning Popular Government are derived (and these are worthy of all respect) from observation of its practical working; a larger portion merely reproduce technical rules of the British or American constitutions in an altered or disguised form; but a multitude of ideas on this subject, ideas which are steadily absorbing or displacing all others, appear to me, like the theories of jurisprudence of which I have spoken, to have been conceived a priori. They are, in fact, another set of deductions from the assumption of a State of Nature. Their true source has never been forgotten on the Continent of Europe, where they are well known to have sprung from the teaching of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who believed that men emerged from the primitive natural condition by a process which made every form of government, except Democracy, illegitimate. In this country they are not often explicitly, or even consciously, referred to their real origin, which is, nevertheless, constantly betrayed by the language in which they are expressed. Democracy is commonly described as having an inherent superiority over every other form of government. It is supposed to advance with an irresistible and preordained movement. It is thought to be full of the promise of blessings to mankind; yet if it fails to bring with it these blessings, or even proves to be prolific of the heaviest calamities, it is not held to deserve condemnation. These are the familiar marks of a theory which claims to be independent of experience and observation on the plea that it bears the credentials of a golden age, non-historical and unverifiable.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Let me quickly explain my reactionary theory of history, which comes from reading weird old forgotten books such as the above. Note that this theory is quite simple. Depending on your inclinations, you may regard this as a good thing or a bad thing.</p>

    <p>In order to get to the reactionary theory of history, we need a reactionary theory of government. History, again, is interpretation, and interpretation requires theory. I&rsquo;ve described this theory before under the name of <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/08/against-political-freedom.html">neocameralism</a>, but on a blog it never hurts to be a little repetitive.</p>

    <p>First: government is not a mystical or mysterious institution. A government is simply a group of people working together for a common aim, ie, a corporation. Whether a government is good or bad is not determined by who its employees are or how they are selected. It is determined by whether the actions of the government are good or bad.</p>

    <p>Second: the only difference between a government and a &ldquo;private corporation&rdquo; is that the former is <em>sovereign</em>: it has no higher authority to which it can appeal to protect its property. A sovereign corporation owns its territory, and maintains that ownership by demonstrating unchallenged control. It is stable if no other party, internal or external, has any incentive to attack it. Especially in the nuclear age, it is not difficult to deter prospective attackers.</p>

    <p>Third: a good government is a well-managed sovereign corporation. Good government is efficient management. Efficient management is profitable management. A profitable government has no incentive to break its promises, abuse its citizens (who are its capital), or attack its neighbors.</p>

    <p>Fourth: efficient management can be implemented by the same techniques in sovereign corporations as in nonsovereign ones. The company&rsquo;s profit is distributed equally to holders of negotiable shares. The shareholders elect a board, which selects a CEO.</p>

    <p>Fifth: although the full neocameralist approach has never been tried, its closest historical equivalents to this approach are the 18th-century tradition of enlightened absolutism as represented by Frederick the Great, and the 21st-century nondemocratic tradition as seen in lost fragments of the British Empire such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Dubai. These states appear to provide a very high quality of service to their citizens, with no meaningful democracy at all. They have minimal crime and high levels of personal and economic freedom. They tend to be quite prosperous. They are weak only in political freedom, and political freedom is unimportant by definition when government is stable and effective.</p>

    <p>Sixth: the comparative success of the American and European postwar systems appears to be due to their abandonment of democratic politics as a practical mechanism of government, in favor of a civil-service <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamtenstaat">Beamtenstaat</a> in which democratic politicians are increasingly symbolic. The post-communist civil-service states, China and Russia, appear to be converging on the same system, although their stability is ensured primarily by direct military authority, rather than by a system of managed public opinion.</p>

    <p>Seventh: the post-democratic civil-service state, while not utterly disastrous, is not the end of history. It has two problems. One, the size and complexity of its regulatory system tends to increase without bound, resulting in economic stagnation and general apathy. Two, more critically, it can neither abolish democratic politics formally, nor defend itself against changes in information flow that may destabilize public opinion. Notably, the rise of the Internet disrupts the feedback loop between public education and political power, allowing noncanonical ideas to flourish. If these ideas are both rationally compelling and politically delegitimating, the state is threatened.</p>

    <p>Eighth: therefore, productive political efforts should focus on peacefully terminating, restructuring and decentralizing the 20th-century civil-service state along neocameralist lines. The ideal result is a planet of thousands, even tens of thousands, of independent city-states, each managed for profit by its shareholders.</p>

    <p>Note that this perspective has nothing at all in common with the Universalist theory of government. Note also the simplicity of the transition that it suggests <em>should</em> have happened, from monarchy as a family business to a modern corporate structure with separate board and CEO, eliminating the vagaries of the hereditary principle.</p>

    <p>Now let&rsquo;s look &mdash; from this reactionary perspective &mdash; at what actually <em>did</em> happen.</p>

    <p>First, in America and Europe from the late 18th through the middle of the 19th century, we see a series of violent changes in power, in which states were overthrown and territories captured by disorganized mobs of their own residents, sometimes in cahoots with the army. These were called <em>revolutions</em>. They were almost entirely destructive phenomena, with no major point to recommend them. There is no revolution in this period which had benign results. The French revolutions of 1789 and 1830, for example, can be blamed entirely on irresolute monarchs without the courage, dexterity or both to use the military against the mob.</p>

    <p>Moreover, even when states did not capitulate totally to revolutionary mobs, they often surrendered partially, as for example in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_Act_1832">Reform Bill</a> of 1832. This led to a progressive acceleration of democracy, and its inevitable accomplice, paramilitary violence. The US, for example, in the height of its democratic period from 1828 to 1932, was almost never without violent elections or political gangs. Democratic government before the civil-service era was also corrupt on an almost indescribable scale.</p>

    <p>Democracy, and democratic ideologies and religions, had become power cults which attracted and selected for the ambitious and unscrupulous. Numerous corrupt systems which could command voting blocs sprung up, from urban ward-heeler machines to yellow-journalist newspapers. Deceiving the voting population was job one for these political engineers, and public opinion on all political subjects &mdash; government, law, economics, and war &mdash; began to diverge significantly from reality.</p>

    <p>This situation culminated in the first great total war of the democratic era, the War of Secession between Union and Confederacy. The proximate cause of the War of Secession was the anti-slavery campaign, a political-religious nationalist movement in the North that harangued the South with apocalyptic rhetoric, supported paramilitary terrorist attacks on it, extracted vast quantities of tax through an almost punitive tariff, unilaterally and informally rewrote the Constitution to strengthen its own power and hold the South captive, and in general did everything it could to stoke Southern paranoia. But the latter was hardly lacking, as the South had developed its own bizarre nationalist movement, a romantic cult which glorified a hereditary caste system and threatened to invade the entire Western hemisphere, Yankeeland excluded &mdash; and only because it was bad land for sugarcane, tobacco or cotton. Neither of these competing nationalisms was conceivable in the 19th century, and both are most parsimoniously ascribed to the effect of 80 years of democracy on the mass mind.</p>

    <p>The War of Secession was a war of mass destruction in which all previously known laws of war were violated, generally by the North with its revived Puritan cult of righteousness. It killed half a million men and brought happiness to none but the killers &mdash; not even the slaves, whose liberation was a sham but whose destitution was certainly not. As such it prefigured the even more destructive wars of the following century. It also destroyed the American tradition of limited government, setting the scene for the megastate to come.</p>

    <p>Probably the most destructive result of the 19th-century democratic movement was the rise of militant nationalism, which beleaguered aristocratic elites found all too effective in deflecting the sympathies of the increasingly violent mob. Contrary to the promises of democrats, the first tastes of socialist plunder only whetted the mob&rsquo;s appetite for more. Democratic factions divided according to their preferred food for this great beast: money or blood.</p>

    <p>This jingoist tendency, also inconceivable in the 18th century, eventually culminated in the war which destroyed European civilization, the Great War. The first outbreak of the Great War, which lasted from 1914 to 1918 killed millions of young men and left Russia in the hands of a barbaric neo-Jacobin military death cult. The same cult later devastated Spain, where order was fortunately restored under a nationalist movement that was at least neither socialist nor expansionist. Finally, the ultimate synthesis of nationalism and socialism, fascism, restarted the Great War, which became a worldwide conflict between the militarist and socialist traditions. At the end of the Great War in 1945, memory of the <em>belle epoque</em> had dwindled to near extinction, and there was no significant political force which supported the restoration of the classical liberal era.</p>

    <p>The US had succumbed to a socialist revolution under false electoral premises in 1932. This was primarily the result of a financial panic, which was caused by unscrupulous dilution of the currency in the boom of the 1920s, through the new Federal Reserve System. After the first phase of the Great War, the gold standard, which was never entirely stable under the Anglo-American fractional-reserve system, had been restored in a broken form (the &ldquo;gold-exchange standard&rdquo;) which was more tolerant of dilution through state-guaranteed maturity-mismatched lending, but not tolerant enough. The collapse of this system allowed inflationist economists to claim that capitalism itself had failed, not unlike the famous orphan who requested clemency for the murder of his parents. This brought on a socialist revolution, the New Deal, in which the Federal government and the Progressive civil-service machine claimed unlimited legislative power to deal with the emergency it had created for itself.</p>

    <p>It has never relinquished this power, nor can it ever be expected to. It has never restored a metallic currency, nor can it ever be expected to. Its civil service and judiciary are entirely insulated from democracy. Its legislative body, which remains bicameral for reasons now only historical, has an incumbent reelection rate in the high 90s. Its two political parties, which are no longer meaningful organizations and are now mere labels, are identical on all substantive domestic policy issues. Most of their efforts are put into fighting proxy wars against each other, often involving American soldiers, on distant parts of the globe which have no relevance at all to domestic security. The Federal government consumes 30% of GNP, and the US borrows 6% of GNP from abroad every year just to stay afloat. Crime is rampant, with many parts of many major cities effectively uninhabitable by any civilized person, and a substantial criminal class. Some cities, such as Detroit, have been entirely cleansed of their white population and in some places are even reverting to prairie (but very dangerous prairie). Former residents of the cities, whose old Irish, Italian and Jewish quarters no longer exist, have fled to more defensible quarters in hideous strip-mall suburbs. Encouraged by both parties, which jockey for their votes, uneducated peasants from Latin America are flooding in unknown numbers across its uncontrolled borders. Fortunately, so far this new generation of immigrants has seen little of the joys of the criminal lifestyle, but this seems to change quickly for their children. In short, the US is rapidly becoming a Third World country, not unlike present-day Brazil. The only mercy is that its respite from democracy has lasted.</p>

    <p>After the Great War, the socialist powers fell out, as gangs often do. The first split was the US-Soviet split, in which the latter turned out to be more interested in territory and power than in a position as a US satellite. In the resulting Cold War, these two powers dismembered the remnants of European law and order in the Third World, in the worst scramble for colonial supremacy the world had yet seen. Any pretext of bringing good government to uncivilized peoples was forgotten, and any nationalist thug, preferably as socialist as possible, was a satisfactory client for either side. Most of the non-European world, including even formerly civilized countries such as China, reverted to the rule of national-socialist warlords who competed for American and Soviet favor. Some, such as Yugoslavia and China, split from both factions and courted the aid of both. Perhaps a hundred million people around the world were murdered in this &ldquo;liberation,&rdquo; which is still revered as such worldwide. The supposedly &ldquo;independent&rdquo; countries of the Third World are still dependent on aid from the US and its European satellites. There is one independent Third World country in the world &mdash; Somaliland.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, competing branches of the US government still engage in Third World proxy wars, in which the Defense Department and its political allies and satellites (the Republican Party, the arms and energy industry, Israel) face off against the State Department and its allies and satellites (the Democratic Party, the NGOs and universities, Europe, Palestine). The true nature of these conflicts, which would end instantly if the US was under unitary leadership, or even if both American factions could agree to cut off all &ldquo;aid&rdquo; to all their foreign satellites, is admitted by no one. It is considered entirely normal that the US often arms, and always talks with, both sides of these bizarre, incurable pseudo-wars.</p>

    <p>Lately, the old Third World national-socialist movement has managed to refit itself with an Islamic facade, and destroyed a couple of very large buildings in New York, killing thousands of people. No effective effort against the perpetrators has been mounted, probably because any successful American military effort brings political prestige to the American right and threatens to reignite the old era of nationalist jingoism, a threat which terrifies the American left &mdash; and for good reason. So many individuals involved with the attack live and continue their efforts in a country which is not at war with the US, nor vice versa. Most Americans consider this entirely normal. The concept of war itself has been under attack for the last fifty years, in favor of an entirely new legal model which is derived from domestic criminal justice, and which seems designed to make it as difficult as possible for civilized forces to defeat uncivilized ones, a theory which certainly fits the short-term political needs of its proponents. The resulting concept of &ldquo;asymmetric warfare&rdquo; is also generally accepted, with only a little grumbling, as a necessary burden that must be shouldered by our great and moral nation.</p>

    <p>Other than this, everything is fine. Technology is moving along pretty well. Moore&rsquo;s Law continues to zoom along. We have fast computers and fancy mobile phones and other things that no one in the 18th century could dream of. If they could see our political system, however, I&rsquo;m afraid they&rsquo;d understand it all too well.</p>

    <p>Frankly, any system of thought that can convincingly present this history as a case of <em>progress</em> is capable of anything. Readers may, of course, differ with my interpretation of events. But hopefully at this point they at least understand why I see Universalism as a parasitic tradition.</p>

    <p>Next week, I&rsquo;ll talk about how Universalism could destroy the world, the species, or at least just civilization. As always, please feel free to anticipate me in the comments.</p>
